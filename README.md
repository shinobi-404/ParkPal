## For Team members
This information was directly taken from the small project git's README.md as that is what I am modeling this repository off of.
### When contributing
- The dev branch should be used where code is being tested and constantly worked on. It will often be ahead of the main branch
- The main branch should be used as the last "stable" version of the code
- For each team please make a seperate branch from the dev branch to start working on your portion of the project
- When working on a feature it sometimes helps to pull from your normal team branch and label the branch as what you're working on. IE: If API wants to work on a feature they would create a branch from 'API' named 'feature1'. Not necessary but organized. You can delete the branch safely when the feature is done being worked on.
- When merging from one of the team branches to dev branch, it should be done through a Pull Request. IE: if merging from 'frontend' to 'dev'
- Other branches are up to you if you want to handle with pull requests.
- dev to main has to be approved by a team member other than the one who made the Pull Request
